## Introduction
SpaceX is a pioneering company leading the revolution in the space industry. It's renowned for its Falcon 9 rocket, which drastically reduces launch costs compared to traditional providers. While competitors charge over $165 million per launch, SpaceX has brought costs down to as low as $62 million by reusing the rocket's first stage. Re-landing and reusing this stage for subsequent missions significantly cut expenses. With each successful reuse, launch prices are expected to drop further, democratizing space exploration. As a data scientist at a startup competing with SpaceX, the focus is on developing predictive models to forecast first-stage landings in future missions. Leveraging machine learning pipelines, the goal is to accurately predict whether a first stage will land successfully, crucial for bidding competitively against SpaceX and optimizing resource allocation.
