# Australia Wildfire Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code to analyze historical wildfire data in Australia. The data is loaded using Pandas and various visualizations are created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

## Data Source
The historical wildfire data is sourced from the link below:
[Historical Wildfires Data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/Historical_Wildfires.csv)

## Requirements
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Folium
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Tasks

### Task 1.1: Average Estimated Fire Area Over Time
Plot a line chart to visualize the change in average estimated fire area over different years.

### Task 1.2: Estimated Fire Area Over Months
Plot a line chart to show how estimated fire area varies across different months for each year.

### Task 1.3: Distribution of Mean Estimated Fire Brightness by Region
Develop a bar plot using Seaborn to understand the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness across different regions.

### Task 1.4: Percentage of Pixels for Presumed Vegetation Fires by Region
Create a pie chart to visualize the portion of count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires in different regions.

### Task 1.6: Histogram of Mean Estimated Fire Brightness
Plot a histogram to show the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness.

### Task 1.7: Distribution of Estimated Fire Brightness by Region
Create a stacked histogram using Seaborn to understand the distribution of estimated fire brightness across different regions.

### Task 1.8: Correlation between Mean Estimated Fire Radiative Power and Mean Confidence Level
Develop a scatter plot to find the correlation between mean estimated fire radiative power and mean confidence level.

### Task 1.9: Marking Regions on the Map
Use Folium to mark regions affected by wildfires on the map of Australia.

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the provided code snippets in your Python environment.
3. Explore the generated visualizations and analysis insights.

Feel free to fork, modify, and experiment with the code to gain deeper insights into Australia's wildfire data.
